Given a Binary Tree of size N, You have to count leaves in it. For example, there are two leaves in following tree

class Node
{
    int data;
    Node left, right;
}*/

class Tree
{
    int countLeaves(Node node) 
    {
         // Your code  
        if(node == null)
            return 0;
        if(node.left == null && node.right == null)
            return 1;
        int count_left = countLeaves(node.left);
        int count_right = countLeaves(node.right);
        return count_left + count_right;
    }
}
